# C-Practice Repository

Welcome to **C-Practice** – my personal space for exploring and improving my understanding of C programming and fundamental computer science concepts. This repository serves as a training ground to learn and practice concepts related to the **C language** and other foundational fields in computer science.

## 🛠 Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:
- Strengthen my knowledge of **C programming**.
- Dive deep into the **basics of computer systems** and how they operate.
- Explore key topics based on my **bachelor's degree syllabus**.

## 📖 Learning Goals

Through this repository, I aim to:
- Understand the low-level workings of computers.
- Build a solid foundation in **C programming** for system-level development.
- Experiment with small-scale implementations of theoretical concepts.

## 🚀 Getting Started
